# Networking and Operating System
As a Devops Engineer you need to know how data communication works at a high level. This will help you to debug network-related issues, such as connectivity between them, services, and more. Plus, you will build the foundation (along with Virtualization) of your understanding of Cloud Computing.  
On the other hand, you will frequently be in front of a terminal with Bash or Powershell, or in your Cloud's terminal. You will hear about standard input or output (I/O). You will also need to have a control of the processes running on your systems, and will eventually work with some form of virtualization. That is why we believe it is important for you to know the basic concepts of an operating system, what parts it is made up of, and how they are related.
