# The Linux Operating System
Most of the UNIX-Like operating systems (OS) share the same structure. It's divided into the parts that saw on [chapter 2](../ch2). We are going to focus on Linux because it's free and you will find some of its flavors while working on real infrastructure. We are not going to explain the internals or how it's designed. We will prepare you so that you feel confident working from the terminal. When doing this you will learn important topics in the linux world. Finally, at this point it's important that you have a host with Linux installed to do the exercise we will provide you. It can be a VM, WSL or a website. 

Before start playing with the terminal we need to know what a terminal is. A terminal is a program that runs a shell. And a shell is a Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the OS from the user point of view. You are likely familiar with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), that's another way end-users interact with the OS. The built-in shell on Linux is Bash, however there are several (Do you know of another? If not, try looking for them).
