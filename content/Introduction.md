At the end of each section you will find exercises to practice what you have read and resources to go deeper into each topic.  

## Application
In order to solve these challenges you will use a TODO application. It was built as independent componets called microservices. Each service is written with a different programming language. The application consists of 5 microservices as follows:
* Users Service
* Authentication Service
* TODOs Service
* Log Message Processor Service
* Frontend Service

An overview of the application and each of its services can be found in following repository:
